== Overview ==

This shows you how to install a copy of the vim-related files that I use. It's
probably not too terribly useful if you're not me, but it's a nice selection
of Vim plugins and tricks if you want to give it a test drive.

Please note that these instructions or *NOT* complete. They are still a
work-in-progress while I learn the basics of git.

== Linux/Mac ==

Download files

        git clone git://github.com/tompurl/dotvim.git ~/.vim

Create Symlinks

        ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
        ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

== Windows ==

=== Prereqs ===

0. Do all of the normal githubby stuff, like registering your ssh key and such.
1. Install msys-git
2. Perform all of these steps from git-bash.bat
3. Make sure that you set your http-proxy properly if necessary. Please see the
   following links for details:
   * https://jmjpro.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/github-behind-corporate-proxy/
   * Also, please note that you *have* to include the port number, even if it's
     80.

Now things are done in a very Mac/Linux-y sort of way:

        $ cd ~
        $ git clone git://github.com/tompurl/dotvim.git ~/vimfiles
        $ ln -s ~/_vimrc ~/vimrc
        $ ln -s ~/_gvimrc ~/gvimrc
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
