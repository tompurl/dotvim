This directory is for projects that don't store their vim-related code under
the root of their project directory. For example, the vimwiki project keeps
it's vim code under $VIMWIKI_ROOT/src folder. Because of this, if you store
the $VIMWIKI_ROOT directory under your pathogen bundle directory, then 
you won't be able to use vimwiki.

Instead, I put those types of project folders under this src folder and then
create a symlink to the folder that contains the vim code directly under
my bundle folder.
