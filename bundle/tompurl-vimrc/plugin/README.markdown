This folder contains a collection of shortcuts and other small modifications
that I have made to my Vim configuration.

Most Vim users keep these types of minor changes in their vimrc file, but I
like to keep my vimrc file as "pristine" as possible. Instead of adding dozens
(or hundreds) of lines of customizations. I therefore keep my customizations
in external files and source them in my vimrc file.
